const EXPLORE_TOPICS = [
  {
    q: "What exactly is a carbon credit?",
    a: "A carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide (or an equivalent greenhouse gas) that has been prevented from entering the atmosphere, or actively removed from it — for example, by planting trees, switching to solar power, or converting waste into biogas instead of letting it release methane. Each verified tonne becomes one tradable credit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is India's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)?",
    a: "CCTS is India's official framework for carbon markets, notified under the Energy Conservation Act. It has two tracks: a compliance mechanism for large energy-intensive industries, and an offset mechanism open to voluntary participants — including universities and institutions — who can register projects, get them verified, and earn Carbon Credit Certificates (CCCs).",
  },
  {
    q: "Who verifies that a project's claims are real?",
    a: "An Accredited Carbon Verification Agency (ACVA) — an independent, government-recognised body — inspects the project, checks records and site evidence, and confirms the actual greenhouse gas reduction before any certificate is issued. No verification, no credits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do institutions actually register?",
    a: "Non-obligated entities (which includes universities and colleges) register and submit their Project Design Document through the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) portal, administered under the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). Tree-plantation-specific projects can alternatively go through the Green Credit Programme.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do credits get sold or traded?",
    a: "Once issued, Carbon Credit Certificates sit in a registry account and can be sold to companies or industries that need to offset their own emissions — either through direct buyer agreements or, eventually, registered carbon exchanges as the market matures.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can go wrong?",
    a: "The most common failure points: starting activity before registration is approved (which can disqualify a project), poor record-keeping that fails verification, and — increasingly — fraudulent brokers charging upfront 'registration fees.' Always verify an agency's accreditation on the official BEE website before paying anyone.",
